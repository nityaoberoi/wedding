          <h2>The Bride</h2>
	  <p>Nitya grew up in Kuwait but her roots still lie in India. She went to UT Austin to pursue Bachelors in Computer Science and Advertising. After a summer internship in Goldman Sachs, she decided she had to partake in doing "God's work" and joined Goldman Sachs in New York full-time in 2006.</p>
	  <p>After 4 years in the financial world, Nitya decided she'd had enough and decided to pursue her true passions - technology and web development. After a short stint in Lime Wire, she joined Yipit as their 6th employee and has been happily hacking away ever since.</p>
	  <p>Nitya closely fits both the cancerian and southpaw stereotypes. She is highly creative and obsessive about her artwork. In fact, Nitya has never lived in an apartment that she didn't paint and decorate herself. Luckily (for me), she takes very little help while doing so.</p>
	  <p>Nitya's biggest passion is probably still travel, specifically adventure travel. Besides trying out various adventure sports, Nitya occasionally pushes the envelope with outrageously daring experiences like spending a week with minimal supplies learning survival skills in the Utah wilderness. Perhaps for this reason, if not any other, she'd be the person I pick to be with if I were stranded on a deserted island.</p>
	  <p>Nitya forms strong and lasting bonds with people and it's no surprise to me that many of her closest friends till date are ones from her time in Kuwait.</p>

            <h2>The Groom</h2>
            <p>Sriram was born and brought up in Chennai where he grew up with his sister, parents, and patti (grandmother). He went to UT, Austin for his Bachelors in Electrical Engineering and on graduating, joined Google as a software engineer, in California. After much coaxing (by me), he finally relented and left the west coast for New York, three years later. Last year, he moved to Spotify to pursue his interest in solving core backend engineering problems and loves it there.</p>
            <p>Sriram is extremely passionate about music; he loves everything from psychedelic rock to classical carnatic. He's also an extremely adept percussionist, in all senses of the word. He first started playing the mirundangam at age 6 after some prodding from his mom and developed a natural sense of rhythm. At university, Sriram played for a band called Omkara. Later, he taught himself the tabla and drums, and he now regularly jams with friends to the tunes of Led Zep, Floyd etc. His other passions include traveling - he's travelled across 17 countries in 6 continents over the past 5 years and is always willing to partake in the next adventure even if it means hiccuping all the way up to the summit of Kilimanjaro.</p>
            <p> Sriram's extremely fun loving and loves to live in the moment. He forms extremely tight bonds with his friends and enjoys spending quality time with them. There's always something to look forward to with him around, and he's truly the best friend I could ever hope to have.</p>

            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>One of my first memories of Sriram was from UT, Austin, when I was at the library, attempting to procure a book stamp for an art project. Sriram worked as a library proctor, and so I asked if he could help out. Not knowing him very well at the time, I was a bit taken aback when he replied with a grin, "What's in it for me?"</p>
            <p>Over the next couple of years at school, we met intermittently and became good friends. When we finally realized we liked each other, it was time for me to graduate and move to New York. Sriram moved to California six months later.</p>
            <p>Today, we've travelled six continents together, over the course of five years, visited four of the world's wonders, survived three long distance years, lived in two home cities, and overall it's been one amazing adventure. Last summer, Sriram took me aback once more with another grin and question when we trekked up Mt. Kilimanjaro. Only this time, his question was, "Will you marry me?"

                <h5>Stella Point, Aug 22 2011 - 8.00 a.m.</h5>
                <p>About five hundred feet beneath Africa's highest peak (Uhuru), balancing unsteadily on a knelt position after an arduous trek uphill, I popped the question "Nitya, would you like to take our relationship to greater heights?" and offered her a ring in exchange for her hand. She said "yes, of course!" and I was overwhelmed with joy.</p>
                  <p>During the five-day ascent up the mountain, I had felt my body struggling under the hostile conditions but each time, I was able to push through a bit further with the hopes of proposing to Nitya near the top. After the proposal, we hugged and I realized how lucky I was to get that far up and have my dreams come true. For a moment, reaching the summit was merely a bonus experience!</p>
